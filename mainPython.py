'''
Let there be a function great, where age and name are two parameters

def greet(name, age):
    print("Your name is: ",name," and your age is: ", age)

    Arguments as positional arguments
    greet(age, name) ==> position of each argument matters, that's what I always use

    Arguments as keyword arguments
    greet(name="Alice", age=25)  # order doesn’t matter
